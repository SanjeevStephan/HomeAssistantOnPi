<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> is an home automation hub. An home automation hub is a place where <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/">different devices</a> with different protocols communicate with each other. 
Home Assistant is the biggest open-source home automation platform to date and it supports 895 different components.

### Installing and Setting Up Home Assistant
To start running Home Assistant on the RPi, you need to install Hass.io.We recommend a dedicated system to run Home Assistant such as a <a href="">Raspberry Pi</a>.

#### SUGGESTED HARDWARE
We will need a few things to get started with installing Home Assistant.
* Raspberry Pi 4 (Raspberry Pi 3 is ok too, if you have one laying around)
* Power Supply for Raspberry Pi 4 or Power Supply for Raspberry Pi 3
* Micro SD Card. Ideally get one that is Application Class 2 as they handle small I/O much more consistently than cards not optimized to host applications. A 32 GB or bigger card is recommended.
* SD Card reader. This is already part of most laptops, but you can purchase a standalone USB adapter if you don’t have one. The brand doesn’t matter, just pick the cheapest.
* Ethernet cable. Required for installation. After installation, Home Assistant can work with Wi-Fi, but an Ethernet connection is more reliable and highly recommended.
